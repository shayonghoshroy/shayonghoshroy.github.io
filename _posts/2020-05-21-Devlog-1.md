# Slashfest: First-Person Slasher on mobile.

## Idea
I want to create a First-Person Slasher mobile game. The player would be able to use their sword to attack and block attacks from an enemy swordsmen. The last person standing wins. The game would have a simple interface and could be played with a just thumb. I have not seen games like this available on the app store, however, they are common on other platforms.

## Gameplay
The player will choose from a variety of attacks or to block in a direction by swiping or tapping their phone in the correct direction. Anywhere the player touches first spawns the center of the directional game pad. Hits or damage will register to a health bar.
* Stamina will be reduced with attacks and unsuccessful blocks. Stamina will be reduced slightly with successful blocks. Combos will drain much more than normal attacks.
### Moves  
* Combo  
A quick attack after another attack.

* Counterattack  
Time slows if you attack, and then right after, the enemy attacks. You get a small time frame to block on the correct direction.

* Parry/Block  
Each block/parry only lasts for half a second. This way, players are forced to time parries perfectly before attacks.

* Riposte  
A quick attack after a successful parry is allowed within a time frame.

* Kicks  
Kicks can go through parries, and can only be countered by other kicks.

* Cancel a move  
Only before a move is completed, you can cancel a move before it is used to trick your opponent into blocking early. Uses stamina.

* Morph  
Stab to swipe or vice versa. Quickly switch attacks after issuing first attack to morph and trick your opponent.

* Chamber  
Mirror the attack a little after the enemy issued it.
Example: You chamber a left swipe with a right swipe.
Allows you to attack immediately after.

## Single Player  
As levels increase, the enemy AI gets smarter and better at sword fighting.
I am going to look into using machine learning (NEAT) to create generations of bots.
* Weapons evolve and change  
* Bosses
* Skins  
* Tactics emerge  
* Powers
* Power-ups  
* Finishers

## Multiplayer
This will consist of online 1v1 duels against other players.
* Leaderboard  
Either using "ELO" ranking, or kill and replace ranking, a global leaderboard will exist and be able to be seen by every player. Each player will have a rank on their profile.
* Skins, Taunts, Emotes, Finishers.  

### Camera
* Vibrations, colors, or popups will be used to make hits satisfying or signal future moves or states from the enemy.
For example, a shield popup for an incoming block.   
* Slow motion can be used during certain moves or right after a block in order to parry.
* The camera should tilt towards attacks and blocks.

# Marketing
* Social media posts  
* YouTube Trailer  
A camera shows normal people in everyday situations on their phone. Perhaps a student not paying attention to a college lecture pulls out his phone and opens Slashfest. Camera cuts to a battlefield where the same person has armor and a sword, and is dueling another armored opponent. Yells, music, and sound effects. Maybe multiple people all dueling.
* Youtube Multiplayer Trailer  
Tournament trailer. Perhaps two students make eye contact across the room inside a classroom. Camera cut to them in armor facing each other with swords. Battle begins.
* Real life Tournament  
Cash prize for a tournament held at the University of South Carolina. The best Slashfest duelist wins.
* Translating and marketing the app to Chinese mobile app markets.  

# Soundtrack
Gus Burgess plans to create a soundtrack of beats that fuses hiphop and movie soundtracks. Individual themes are needed for the following.
* Loading menu
* Main menu
* Beginning of round setup
* Beginning of the duel
* Enemy health is low  
* Player health is low  
* Victory  
* Defeat
